<p>In an entreprenuership in information course, my partner and I worked on tackling the issue of patient educaiton in complex and pediatric hospital environments. Piggybacking off my work in <a href="/bmt.html">bone marrow transplant</a>, we conducted KJ Method research on issue faced by clinical staff in this hospital unit.  
</p>
<p>
We developed a prototype of Compass, a clinician-facing task management tool that helps medical professionals educate patients.  Unlike traditional electronic health record software, BMT Compass focuses on what our target users say they want- discrete steps instead of long form documentation. By offering an easy-to-use system that reports back to proprietary EHRs, we empower staff to better educate patients and ultimately improve outcomes for families.
